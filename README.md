## Introduction
This is the official repository for my front-end developer portfolio showcasing the projects and teams I've worked with. 

The websites UX/UI was designed from scratch in Figma, developed based on mockups, and then migrated to GitHub where it is now managed and updated. It utilizes good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a few extra libraries and content. You can find those below.

This portfolio is open source, which means it is free to download, use, and distribute under the GPL 3.0 license. For more information on the thought process that went into making this portfolio, feel free to reach out to me.

You can find the website [here](https://marioferrera.com).
